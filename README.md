This project is a photo gallery for my own photography (and also my attempt to learn React). This project features me building a few of my own components from scrach, utilizing external components, playing around with flexbox, and consuming the google maps API to show clients where I have photographed and what album link to the pins on the map.

I eventually will build this out into a full stack web-app and host my photos elsewhere (s3,firebase,etc).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
